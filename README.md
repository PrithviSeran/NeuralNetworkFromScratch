# NeuralNetworkFromScratch

This deep learning project is made alongside the "Neural Networks From Scratch" e-book. 
The e-book goes over the basics of neural networks, such as neurons, activation functions and loss functions. As demonstrated in the project,
these fundamentals have been coded from scratch. The book also cover intermediate techniques for neural networks such as stochastic gradient descent,
optimization functions, and regularization. 

The book also shows you how to load datasets, use them to train networks, save the networks, and how to load them again. 
All of this is done without the use of a deep learning framework. 

This project is intended to show the underlying computations in neural networks that are typically hidden when using deep learning frameworks. This
project was also a learning experience for me as this was my first hands-on experience with neural networks.

## fashion_mnist.model

This is a saved pre-trained neural network that takes in as input 28-by-28 pixel image of clothing (shirts, pants, hats, shoes, etc), and outputs what type of clothing the inputed image is. 
The model has been trained on the fashion MNIST model, a dataset of 28-by-28 pixel images of clothes. This dataset is free to download off the internet.
